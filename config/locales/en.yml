# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'

        header1: "About Wright Piano School"
        paragraph1: "Andrew Wright began the Wright Piano School in the Hague in 2009 as a private teaching practice. Due to increasing demand the Wright Piano School has grown to include several other expert teachers and a full calendar of activities, including guest masterclasses, recitals, exams and group classes."
        paragraph2: "Students of Andrew Wright have gone on to be accepted to the most important conservatoires of the Netherlands (Amsterdam, Utrecht, the Hague) and have been successful in national and international competitions such as the Prinses Christina Concours, the Concertgebouw Concours and the Holland International Piano Competition. In November 2015, Nathan Schaumann (15-year-old student of Andrew Wright) won first prize in his age category in the Young Pianist Foundation Competition, the most important piano competition in Holland."
        paragraph3_1: "The Wright Piano School places emphasis on inspiration, hard work and achievement. Some students are on their way to becoming professional musicians, while others simply play for fun. The teachers find ways to help all students advance through regular practice. Luckily, the many performances opportunities offered to students provide great motivation, as students are always practicing toward a performance. The sense of accomplishment from each recital, masterclass or exam performance keeps them working hard! All of the associate teachers at the Wright Piano School are highly qualified with a degree in piano and an affinity for teaching. Besides Andrew Wright, who holds a PhD from Leiden University, Sofia Skopou and Stefan Petrovic are also currently finishing PhD degrees in piano, a level of qualification not found among faculty in any other music schools in the Netherlands. The other associates all have degrees appropriate to their specialization within the school. Please check out the"
